Hi, Iâ€™m Finn Solvikâ€”an indie developer focused on building modern, open source web apps.

My mission is to create software thatâ€™s powerful, beautifully designed, and easy for anyone to use or adapt.

I release full, production-grade applications under open licensesâ€”tools for devs, solo founders, and small teams who want to own their stack.

Youâ€™ll recognize my work: clean architecture, practical features, and a focus on real-world needs.

ðŸ’» Always building, never standing still

ðŸ”„ Everything open, always improving
